        <p> I hope one day to completely bridge the gap between humans and technology
        to create the first fully functioning cyborg. This cyborg will also become the president
        of the world exactly 2 months after its creation. By this time, I will be around 27 years old
        and would've already received my 3rd Nobel Peace Prize and well on my way to being the real
        world's Ironman.</p>
